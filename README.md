# front-end
StoryCreate... is a Social Storytelling Community Platform that is created to provide affordable entertainment, 
sense of belonging in a community and an outlet for creatives to display their art while earning from their work. 
Our platform values diversity & equality the most. We provide different ways to tell stories on our platform from 
text written chapters to animated story episodes,thus giving creatives in different fields the opportunity to create 
stories based on their skills. For our Users that wish to enjoy these Stories, we have a fair earning system that will
reward users for their engagement on the platform. Our goal is to monetize the platform so that we earn through ads,
subscriptions, in-platform purchases, and in-platform currency conversion fees. The platform has 3 types of currencies, 
the main/biggest currency would need to be converted to in order to cashout. Depending on what the creatives choose they 
can cashout either weekly, bi-weekly or monthly. For creatives(partnered) that want payment upfront , they would not earn commissions. 
We also plan to have a money-free way to subscribe to the subscription by paying with in-platform currency.
