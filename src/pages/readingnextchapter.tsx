                <h3 className="chapter-title"> Sebastian's POV </h3>
                <pre className="chapter-1"> I had been here for a week, and I already knew that Malik would not stop being a
                pain to <br /> deal with. I tried my best to act according to what he wanted, but it was hard,
                especially <br /> because we spent a lot of time alone. He had this look in his eyes when he got
                lost in <br /> his thoughts, and it pained me I couldn’t help him. <br /> <br />

                As much as I felt as if he had changed, I still found huge chunks remained the same, which <br />
                reminded me of the person he was five years ago. His face had not aged a single day, and his <br />
                youthful features made it difficult to believe his actual age. He now had blond hair that <br />
                complimented his dark skin and made it impossible not to steal a second glance, especially <br /> when
                he flashed his pristine smile.  <br /> <br />

                Malik was pretty muscular, but I always had a more physical profile compared to him. <br /> That would
                easily explain our new stations in life. He was still partial to free shirts and pants <br /> because
                they made him comfortable. We were not on the best of terms, but I could <br /> reach him anytime I
                wanted because that was part of the job description.  <br /> <br />

                “Mr. Aguilar, I think I’m good by myself right now.” <br /> <br />

                His eyes met mine, and I raised an eyebrow in return. If it were the Malik I knew, he would <br /> have
                backed down timidly, but this side was different. He raised an eyebrow back in question, <br />
                challenging me. <br /> <br />

                “I have to be in the same room as you considering I am your security detail. Don’t worry;
                I <br /> won’t follow you into your room if you don’t need me there. But this is a big house. <br /> I can’t
                have  you wandering by yourself and not be able to reach you if you need me.” <br /> <br />

                “Your presence is far too distracting for me to enjoy my meal. I wish for some alone time, <br /> but
                it seems like you prefer to do what you want when you please.”  <br /> <br />

                I struggled to keep my tone leveled. “This is my job.” <br /> <br />

                “And as your boss, I am telling you to excuse me.” <br /> <br />

                He took every opportunity to remind me of my place as if I could ever forget.   <br /> <br />

                “Very well then,” I replied, succumbing to his authority as I walked away. <br /> <br />

                He tried, but he could not hide the smile that threatened to break from the corner of his lips.  <br /> <br />

                I could feel the smugness in how he turned to look at me, reveling in his latest win. I was <br />
                also a little amused too because I knew he could not take half of the punishment he was <br />
                dishing my way. I chose to be the bigger person and live to joust another day. I knew there <br />
                would always be another day as long as I did not overstep my boundaries. Time moved by <br /> rather
                swiftly since I started staying in his house, so I knew it wouldn’t be long before <br /> I got one
                over him too. <br /> <br />

                The air was cooler in these parts, and I did not need to worry about pleasing him too much like <br />
                I had to in the past. I shook my head as I found myself thinking too much about Malik. A fresh <br />
                start was all I needed, and I was on my way to creating a new path for myself and never <br />
                revisiting my dark past. <br />

                I remained in my room until I stopped hearing the clinking of metal utensils on ceramic plates. <br />
                In its place, I heard a man’s voice. I pushed myself off the bed immediately and hurried back <br />
                to the dining room. The person I saw sitting beside Malik stopped me in my tracks. <br /> <br />

                “Sebas?” He asked, tilting his head. He turned to Malik. “Malik, is that Sebas?” <br /> <br />

                Malik turned his head away. Even he had nothing to say to his older brother. Amir was the <br />
                smallest man in the room, but something about him exuded the confidence of someone <br /> that had
                been important for most of his life. His status was immediately apparent, <br /> even to people
                that had never seen him before. <br /> <br />

                “Hello, Amir,” I greeted, unsure of how to react to seeing my best friend after such a long time. <br /> <br />

                “Knock it off and come here, you ass!” <br /> <br />

                He took big strides toward me and opened his arms to hug me. Malik looked away as <br /> our eyes met
                while I patted his brother’s back, an action that Amir also reciprocated. He shook <br /> his head with
                disbelief as we separated after a few seconds.  <br /> <br />

                “It’s really good to have you back, man. It has been far too long,” Amir said before turning <br /> to
                Malik. “Why didn’t you tell me Sebas was here?” <br /> <br />

                “He’s here for work. He’s my new security detail. Besides, I don’t recall inviting you to my <br /> home.”

                “Your new security detail?” Amir turned to me with the same frown on his face as <br /> when he
                addressed his brother. “Why the hell are you working for this brat?” <br /> <br />

                “Unlike you, Amir, my life is actually worth being guarded.” <br /> <br />

                They bickered while I stood in place and watched them. At a different time, I would have <br />
                interjected in their banter and have them turn on me, but I knew my position, even though <br />
                Amir was doing his best to release me from my servitude. They were never on the same page <br />
                on most things because they were different people. However, they still found a way to make <br />
                it work. Amir was the one person Malik confided everything with. The only thing he kept <br /> from
                him was our relationship.  <br /> <br />

                “Your security detail is going to be busy with me for a while, so go paint a tree or something.” <br /> <br />

                “Fuck you, Amir.”  <br /> <br />

                Malik trudged off, reminding me of the first time I saw him all those years ago.  <br /> <br />

                “Come here, man. We have a lot to talk about.” <br /> <br />

                With that, Amir pulled me into another living room in the mansion. He knew the house like <br /> the
                back of his hand, and yet Malik treated him like a stranger. Amir was as curious <br /> as I expected,
                asking me all the questions that popped into his head. <br /> <br />

                Going from a Navy SEAL to a bodyguard was a common carer arc for ex–military guys, <br /> but Amir still
                prodded. Knowing him, he wanted to get inside my head and see what was <br /> going on inside. I had
                no reason to lie, though; I left for only one reason. <br /> <br />

                “I got tired of living that life. It was almost like I was living a life that wasn’t <br /> mine, a
                life I couldn’t be proud of. The suits in the  Pentagon always found a way of making <br /> life
                harder than it should be, and we have to go in to clean their messes while bullets <br /> fly overhead.”

                We continued talking, laughing as we shared memories again. It was a breath <br /> of fresh air to
                see that Amir too, who had not aged either. He was still the same <br /> person I remembered him
                to be, and it was amazing seeing someone familiar again. He left <br /> after staying for two hours,
                wishing me luck with Malik. <br /> <br />

                “Are you done dillydallying now?” Malik asked as he returned to find me sitting alone at the <br /> table. <br /> <br />

                “I apologize, sir,” I stood up to leave, not in the mood for him to allow him to get under <br /> my skin. 

                “This is not why I employed you. I didn’t bring you here to spend all afternoon <br /> chatting up a
                storm with my brother. You’re my employee, and you should <br /> understand boundaries.” <br /> <br />

                I held back from asking if he understood how close he was to my body. Looking down at him <br /> made
                some thoughts stream into my mind, and I struggled to push them away. My eyes <br /> remained fixated
                on his lips as he continued talking, demonstrating with his hands. He would <br /> have my head for
                what I was about to do. <br /> <br />

                “And you realize-” <br /> <br />

                His words melted into my mouth as I pressed my lips against his. Malik didn’t struggle or <br />
                shove me away. Instead, his hands came to my arms, and he held them. Our tongues met, <br /> accompanied
                he only groaned louder. <br /> <br />

                “What the fuck was that? Don’t do that ever again!” <br /> <br />

                The anger in his eyes was back, and I kept my head down. Frustrating him wasn’t my <br /> intention,
                but that was definitely one effective way to shut him up. <br /> <br />
