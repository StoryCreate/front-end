                  I had been here for a week, and I already knew that Malik would not stop being a pain to
                  deal with. I tried my best to act according to what he wanted, but it was hard, especially
                  because we spent a lot of time alone. He had this look in his eyes when he got lost in
                  his thoughts, and it pained me I couldn’t help him.

                  As much as I felt as if he had changed, I still found huge chunks remained the same, which
                  reminded me of the person he was five years ago. His face had not aged a single day, and his
                  youthful features made it difficult to believe his actual age. He now had blond hair that
                  complimented his dark skin and made it impossible not to steal a second glance, especially
                  when he flashed his pristine smile.

                  Malik was pretty muscular, but I always had a more physical profile compared to him.
                  That would easily explain our new stations in life. He was still partial to free shirts and pants
                  because they made him comfortable. We were not on the best of terms, but I could
                  reach him anytime I wanted because that was part of the job description.

                  “Mr. Aguilar, I think I’m good by myself right now.”

                  His eyes met mine, and I raised an eyebrow in return. If it were the Malik I knew, he would
                  have backed down timidly, but this side was different. He raised an eyebrow back in question,
                  challenging me.

                  “I have to be in the same room as you considering I am your security detail. Don’t worry; I
                  won’t follow you into your room if you don’t need me there. But this is a big house.
                  I can’t have  you wandering by yourself and not be able to reach you if you need me.”

                  “Your presence is far too distracting for me to enjoy my meal. I wish for some alone time,
                  but it seems like you prefer to do what you want when you please.”

                  I struggled to keep my tone leveled. “This is my job.”

                  “And as your boss, I am telling you to excuse me.”

                  He took every opportunity to remind me of my place as if I could ever forget.

                  “Very well then,” I replied, succumbing to his authority as I walked away.

                  He tried, but he could not hide the smile that threatened to break from the corner of his lips.

                  I could feel the smugness in how he turned to look at me, reveling in his latest win. I was
                  also a little amused too because I knew he could not take half of the punishment he was
                  dishing my way. I chose to be the bigger person and live to joust another day. I knew there
                  would always be another day as long as I did not overstep my boundaries. Time moved by
                  rather swiftly since I started staying in his house, so I knew it wouldn’t be long before
                  I got one over him too.

                  The air was cooler in these parts, and I did not need to worry about pleasing him too much like
                  I had to in the past. I shook my head as I found myself thinking too much about Malik. A fresh
                  start was all I needed, and I was on my way to creating a new path for myself and never
                  revisiting my dark past.
                  I remained in my room until I stopped hearing the clinking of metal utensils on ceramic plates.
                  In its place, I heard a man’s voice. I pushed myself off the bed immediately and hurried back
                  to the dining room. The person I saw sitting beside Malik stopped me in my tracks.

                  “Sebas?” He asked, tilting his head. He turned to Malik. “Malik, is that Sebas?”

                  Malik turned his head away. Even he had nothing to say to his older brother. Amir was the
                  smallest man in the room, but something about him exuded the confidence of someone
                  that had been important for most of his life. His status was immediately apparent,
                  even to people that had never seen him before.

                  “Hello, Amir,” I greeted, unsure of how to react to seeing my best friend after such a long time.

                  “Knock it off and come here, you ass!”

                  He took big strides toward me and opened his arms to hug me. Malik looked away as
                  our eyes met while I patted his brother’s back, an action that Amir also reciprocated. He shook
                  his head with disbelief as we separated after a few seconds.

                  “It’s really good to have you back, man. It has been far too long,” Amir said before turning
                  to Malik. “Why didn’t you tell me Sebas was here?”

                  “He’s here for work. He’s my new security detail. Besides, I don’t recall inviting you to my
                  home.” “Your new security detail?” Amir turned to me with the same frown on his face as
                  when he addressed his brother. “Why the hell are you working for this brat?”

                  “Unlike you, Amir, my life is actually worth being guarded.”

                  They bickered while I stood in place and watched them. At a different time, I would have
                  interjected in their banter and have them turn on me, but I knew my position, even though
                  Amir was doing his best to release me from my servitude. They were never on the same page
                  on most things because they were different people. However, they still found a way to make
                  it work. Amir was the one person Malik confided everything with. The only thing he kept
                  from him was our relationship.

                  “Your security detail is going to be busy with me for a while, so go paint a tree or something.”

                  “Fuck you, Amir.”

                  Malik trudged off, reminding me of the first time I saw him all those years ago.

                  “Come here, man. We have a lot to talk about.”

                  With that, Amir pulled me into another living room in the mansion. He knew the house like
                  the back of his hand, and yet Malik treated him like a stranger. Amir was as curious
                  as I expected, asking me all the questions that popped into his head.

                  Going from a Navy SEAL to a bodyguard was a common carer arc for ex–military guys,
                  but Amir still prodded. Knowing him, he wanted to get inside my head and see what was
                  going on inside. I had no reason to lie, though; I left for only one reason.

                  “I got tired of living that life. It was almost like I was living a life that wasn’t
                  mine, a life I couldn’t be proud of. The suits in the  Pentagon always found a way of making
                  life harder than it should be, and we have to go in to clean their messes while bullets
                  fly overhead.” We continued talking, laughing as we shared memories again. It was a breath
                  of fresh air to see that Amir too, who had not aged either. He was still the same
                  person I remembered him to be, and it was amazing seeing someone familiar again. He left
                  after staying for two hours, wishing me luck with Malik.

                  “Are you done dillydallying now?” Malik asked as he returned to find me sitting alone at the
                  table.

                  “I apologize, sir,” I stood up to leave, not in the mood for him to allow him to get under
                  my skin.  “This is not why I employed you. I didn’t bring you here to spend all afternoon
                  chatting up a storm with my brother. You’re my employee, and you should
                  understand boundaries.”

                  I held back from asking if he understood how close he was to my body. Looking down at him
                  made some thoughts stream into my mind, and I struggled to push them away. My eyes
                  remained fixated on his lips as he continued talking, demonstrating with his hands. He would
                  have my head for what I was about to do.

                  “And you realize-”

                  His words melted into my mouth as I pressed my lips against his. Malik didn’t struggle or
                  shove me away. Instead, his hands came to my arms, and he held them. Our tongues met,
                  accompanied he only groaned louder.

                  “What the fuck was that? Don’t do that ever again!”

                  The anger in his eyes was back, and I kept my head down. Frustrating him wasn’t my
                  intention, but that was definitely one effective way to shut him up.
