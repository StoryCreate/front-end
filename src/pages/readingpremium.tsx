                <h3 className="chapter-title"> Malik's POV </h3>
                <pre className="chapter-1"> A groan threatened to make its way out of my throat as my personal assistant
                    brought him<br /> in. Sebastian, the one person I had grown to hate, was standing
                    right in front of me. <br />
                    <br />

                    “This is a joke, right?” <br />
                    <br />

                    Anna shook her head, introducing us and ignoring me. “Sir, this is Sebastian
                    Aguilar, your<br /> new security detail and bodyguard.” <br /> <br />

                    He nodded, looking at me with a glint in his eyes that I ignored. I waved Anna off,
                    releasing<br /> her to go back to her duties at the office. As she left my mansion, I knew I
                    would hate every<br /> second I had to spend alone with him. <br /> <br />

                    “New house, aye?” <br /> <br />

                    “I’ll appreciate it if you understand your position here, Mr. Aguilar. You will refer to
                    me as Sir<br /> or Mr. Davis. You cannot speak to me like I’m your buddy, at least not while you
                    are on the<br /> clock, on  my dime.” <br /> <br />

                    His jaw ticked at my tone, and I walked away from him before the thudding of my heart<br />
                    reached his ears. This had to be the universe punishing me—first, a stalker, then a
                    break-in,<br /> and now this! My life had been too good lately; I knew I was due some bad luck
                    at some point.<br /> But who was I to complain?  <br /> <br />

                    I had a job that I loved making art for the stars, and it made me a freshly minted
                    billionaire.<br /> Of course, there would be a few bumps in the road.  <br /> <br />

                    “Is there anything else you’ll like to know, Mr. Aguilar?” I turned to face him with as
                    straight a<br /> face as I could manage. As my assistant must have briefed you, you’re staying
                    in my house.” <br /> <br />

                    “I’m aware of that, sir.” <br /> <br />

                    “Good. Anything else?” I asked, sparing him a glance over my shoulder. “This is your room.” <br /> <br />

                    “Do you have any cameras in the house? Something I can look through to see the culprit,<br />
                    at least?” <br /> <br />

                    I shook my head. It wasn’t something I ever considered having in my home. All my life, I
                    had<br /> lived without having to be so cautious, but I didn’t have such luxury anymore. Perhaps<br />
                    installing cameras would be excellent precaution to take after all. <br /> <br />

                    “I’ll like your opinions on the things you believe might be best to improve the security
                    status of<br /> the house. If you think of anything that can help you with your work too, please
                    let me know<br /> or relate to Anna.” <br /> <br />

                    “I’ll get to work with finding the perfect surveillance cameras to install in the house.
                    It’s rather<br /> unbelievable that a house as big as this doesn’t have one.” <br /> <br />

                    Knowing Sebastian, I was certain that would not be his last snide remark, but I did not
                    have<br /> the patience for his jabs. Not today, not ever. I walked out of his room, taking two
                    steps at a<br /> time to mine. The instant I got into my room, I felt my shoulders sag. <br /> <br />

                    Who would have thought he would be back so soon? Just how long had it been since I saw<br /> him?
                    How could he be the best security detail they could find? <br /> <br />

                    My thoughts were moving in different directions. My body responded to the sight of him<br /> the
                    instant I saw him. I hated that he still had that kind of effect on me. My brain knew<br />
                    better than to feel anything for him, though. It had to be the trauma messing with my
                    senses.<br /> <br />

                    The sound of my phone buzzing shook me out of my reverie. I looked at the screen and<br />
                    immediately ended the call with irritation. The No-Caller ID designation on the screen was
                    all<br /> the warning I needed to know that I had no business talking to the person on the line.
                    I had<br /> all the numbers I needed saved on my phone, and my acquaintances could only reach<br /> me
                    through Anna. <br /> <br />

                    “Mr. Davis?”<br /> <br />

                    As if on cue, I heard Sebastian’s voice on the other side of the door. I looked to the sky
                    as I let<br /> out an exasperated sigh. The queue of people I did not want to talk to just
                    continued to grow.<br /> I opened the door slightly, only popping my head around the corner to
                    ask what he wanted. <br /> <br />

                    Sebastian only had a few inches on me in height, but my angled position meant that I had
                    to<br /> crane my neck to make eye contact with him. I recognized the smug smile on his face,
                    the<br /> dimpled smile that accompanied most of his mischief. <br /> <br />

                    “What do you want?” I asked.<br /> <br />

                    “Can we talk?” he asked. <br />
                    “About what?”<br /> <br />

                    I winced a little at the curtness of my response. I was second-guessing myself at every
                    turn,<br /> and it was because he seemed so impervious to the internal turmoil that our reunion
                    started<br /> inside me. Seeing him, I felt like a naive 19-year-old again, needing him to
                    stroll in to save me.<br /> <br />

                    He always had confidence, never seemed to know his place and a reckless attitude that I
                    could<br /> not resist. I knew I was no longer that person. I just needed to show, but I also
                    did not need to<br /> show him too hard because I did not need him to think that I cared in the
                    first place. <br /> <br />

                    I opened the door completely and uncurled to my full height. It meant I could get a good
                    look<br /> at him too. Damn his good genes for making him 6 feet of hard-to-resist masculinity.<br /> <br />

                    “I feel there’s some tension between us, and we need to work it out before we proceed with<br /> our relationship.<br /> <br />

                    “What relationship” I snapped.<br /> <br />

                    “Our working relationship,” he replied at an even pace that made me even more miffed.
                    “And I<br /> was referring to this attitude, sir.”<br /> <br />

                    The smug smile was still on his face, as he seemed to be enjoying making me uncomfortable<br />
                    in my own home. <br /> <br />

                    “As I said earlier, we don’t have to talk about anything as long as I’m paying for the
                    time. So,<br /> please act like a professional and erase any sentiments or personal relations
                    that might get in<br /> the way of doing your job, Mr. Aguilar.”<br /> <br />

                    Sebastian turned to leave and thought better of it almost immediately. He turned to face
                    me.<br /> “Are you just going to pretend like we never meant anything to each other, Malik?”<br /> <br />

                    “That’s because you’re nothing to me, Sebastian!” I replied. It was my turn to sport a
                    smug smile.<br /> “Can’t you try to stop being so self-centered for once and maybe consider that
                    the world doesn’t<br /> revolve around you?”<br /> <br />

                    The tick in his jaw was back. He stared at me directly, and then I followed his gaze as
                    it traveled<br /> down the rest of my body. I hated it so much, but I missed it more than I
                    hated it. It was a<br /> wonder how the human mind worked. All along, I had kept him away from
                    my mind, but once<br /> he appeared, I couldn’t get him out.<br /> <br />

                    “I’m sorry for leaving. I’m sorry that I did not tell you, but you know I had to.”<br /> <br />

                    “I’m way past all of that, Sebastian. Whatever relationship we had ended when you left.<br />
                    I would like you to respect this one we’re building now. Understood?”<br /> <br />

                    “Yes, sir.”<br /> <br />

                    “I’ll return to my room unless you need something else.” <br /> <br />

                    He shook his head slowly and calmly walked away from my door. I shut the door, turned the<br />
                    key behind it, and it locked with a click that I hoped he heard. I could suddenly breathe
                    fine<br /> again.  <br /> <br />

                    There was so much going on already, and now I had to deal with the crush I had on
                    Sebastian<br /> over five years ago, from when I was merely 19 years old. The universe really
                    had a funny sense<br /> of humor, and it seemed to be enjoying throwing curve balls my way these
                    last few days.  <br /> <br />

                    I remembered the breathing techniques my private Yoga instructor taught me, and I took<br />
                    breaths until my breath returned to normal.<br /> <br />

                    “Just how much more do I have to hold on?” I mumbled to myself, walking to my bed and<br />
                    throwing myself on the soft cushions.<br /> <br />

                    My life was supposed to be easier when I no longer had to word about money, but a stalker<br />
                    and a love interest from a past life later, and I was back in the eye of the storm.   <br /> <br />

                    I wanted to be happy and live a peaceful life as an artist. My passion kept me going even<br />
                    through the toughest times, and now my life was in danger because of it. <br /> <br />

                    And of all the people who could protect me, it just had to be Sebastian <br /> <br />
